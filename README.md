# space-invaders
Using C#, the XNA framework and Visual Studio 2010. 
This program was made in early 2015 and my knowledge of Object Orientation and classes was limited. 
The program runs and meets the requirements of the game, but the code is not the best.
Looking back on the code I can see many places where classes could have been used to greater effect.
